### Task 3: Use an Embedding with a DNN Model
"""
In this task, we'll implement our DNN model using an embedding column. An embedding column takes sparse data as input and returns a lower-dimensional dense vector as output.

NOTE: An embedding_column is usually the computationally most efficient option to use for training a model on sparse data. In an optional section at the end of this exercise, we'll discuss in more depth the implementational differences between using an embedding_column and an indicator_column, and the tradeoffs of selecting one over the other.

In the following code, do the following:

Define the feature columns for the model using an embedding_column that projects the data into 2 dimensions (see the TF docs for more details on the function signature for embedding_column).
Define a DNNClassifier with the following specifications:
Two hidden layers of 20 units each
Adagrad optimization with a learning rate of 0.1
A gradient_clip_norm of 5.0

NOTE: In practice, we might project to dimensions higher than 2, like 50 or 100. But for now, 2 dimensions is easy to visualize.

#### A Final Word
"""
We may have gotten a DNN solution with an embedding that was better than our original linear model, but the linear model was also pretty good and was quite a bit faster to train. Linear models train more quickly because they do not have nearly as many parameters to update or layers to backprop through.

In some applications, the speed of linear models may be a game changer, or linear models may be perfectly sufficient from a quality standpoint. In other areas, the additional model complexity and capacity provided by DNNs might be more important. When defining your model architecture, remember to explore your problem sufficiently so that you know which space you're in.

## Optional Discussion: Trade-offs between embedding_column and indicator_column

"""
Conceptually when training a LinearClassifier or a DNNClassifier, there is an adapter needed to use a sparse column. TF provides two options: embedding_column or indicator_column.

When training a LinearClassifier (as in Task 1), an embedding_column in used under the hood. As seen in Task 2, when training a DNNClassifier, you must explicitly choose either embedding_column or indicator_column. This section discusses the distinction between the two, and the trade-offs of using one over the other, by looking at a simple example.

Suppose we have sparse data containing the values "great", "beautiful", "excellent". Since the vocabulary size we're using here is  V=50 , each unit (neuron) in the first layer will have 50 weights. We denote the number of terms in a sparse input using  s . So for this example sparse data,  s=3 . For an input layer with  V  possible values, a hidden layer with  d  units needs to do a vector-matrix multiply:  (1×V)∗(V×d) . This has  O(V∗d)  computational cost. Note that this cost is proportional to the number of weights in that hidden layer and independent of  s .

If the inputs are one-hot encoded (a Boolean vector of length  V  with a 1 for the terms present and a 0 for the rest) using an indicator_column, this means multiplying and adding a lot of zeros.

When we achieve the exact same results by using an embedding_column of size  d , we look up and add up just the embeddings corresponding to the three features present in our example input of "great", "beautiful", "excellent":  (1×d)+(1×d)+(1×d) . Since the weights for the features that are absent are multiplied by zero in the vector-matrix multiply, they do not contribute to the result. Weights for the features that are present are multiplied by 1 in the vector-matrix multiply. Thus, adding the weights obtained via the embedding lookup will lead to the same result as in the vector-matrix-multiply.

When using an embedding, computing the embedding lookup is an  O(s∗d)  computation, which is computationally much more efficient than the  O(V∗d)  cost for the indicator_column in sparse data for which  s  is much smaller than  V . (Remember, these embeddings are being learned. In any given training iteration it is the current weights that are being looked up.)

As we saw in Task 3, by using an embedding_column in training the DNNClassifier, our model learns a low-dimensional representation for the features, where the dot product defines a similarity metric tailored to the desired task. In this example, terms that are used similarly in the context of movie reviews (e.g., "great" and "excellent") will be closer to each other the embedding space (i.e., have a large dot product), and terms that are dissimilar (e.g., "great" and "bad") will be farther away from each other in the embedding space (i.e., have a small dot product).
